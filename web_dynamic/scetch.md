1- They are asking us to use the id..
so we will obay

2- We will do as follows..
- We will make an empty list (and dictionary)
- we will bind the change event listener to each input and within it
	- If checked.. we will add and element to the object and add the name to the names array
	- else.. we will delete them

	as somehting changed... we need to reflect hte change in the page
	so will fill the h4 with the elements of the names after the last change


## note.. we can have only one amenity.. or alot
so if one.. we need no commas
but if more that one.. we need a comma and  a space as a deleimet

so.. remember in python where we used the function "join"?
Same in JS

so now to work



but a question..
why making a list of names if we will already make an object of IDs and names..
‚Åâ

valid one


Let's try and see where is hte problem
